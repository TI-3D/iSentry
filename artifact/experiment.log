wgpu error: Validation Error

Caused by:
  In Device::create_compute_pipeline
    Downlevel flags DownlevelFlags(COMPUTE_SHADERS) are required but not supported on the device.
This is not an invalid use of WebGPU: the underlying API or device does not support enough features to be a fully compliant implementation. A subset of the features can still be used. If you are running this program on native and not in a browser and wish to work around this issue, call Adapter::downlevel_properties or Device::downlevel_properties to get a listing of the features the current platform supports.
